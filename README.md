# What bin Is It?!

A total non-issue. But a fun foray into creating a solution anyway.

## What? (bin is it?)

Annoyances are still annoyances, and I wanted a quicker way to find out which bin to put out each week.

Sure, I can go to my local councils website, find the section for waste collection dates, enter in my postcode, click a button, enter in my address, and wait for the results.

...

BORING!!

## Why?

Much rather find out in **one single click!** Yahoo!

And I was curious to see if there was API data for this. There is.
